# Media Key Controller
## Why?
I made this to easily control media playing on my PC in games such as Forza 4: Horizon, but if you're playing any game on a PC and want to control your media without having to reach to the keyboard, this will work.

## Usage
### Customising
If you'd like to customise the inputs, clone it and modify the source code. I might eventually add a GUI in which you can change the key binds.

### Default

Download as a ZIP, extract and create a shortcut for the executable located in 'dist', place it where you want it to be located and run it. 
It can remain in the background and still read inputs, but the program must remain open.

## Controls
With [DS4Windows](http://ds4windows.com/) installed, this should also work. XB1/XB360 controller capability is available by default with no pre-requisite.
