# Media Key Controller
## Why?
I made this to easily control media playing on my PC in games such as Forza 4: Horizon, but if you're playing any game on a PC and want to control your media without having to reach to the keyboard, this will work.

## Usage
### Customising
If you'd like to customise the inputs, clone it and modify the source code. I might eventually add a GUI in which you can change the key binds.
### Default
